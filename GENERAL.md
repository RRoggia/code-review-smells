# General 
## G1 Multiple Languages in One Source File
Having multiple languages in the same source file difficults readability.

Suggestion: Split in different source files.

:-1:
````java
public void doSomething(String title) {
    String html = "<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n" + "<html>\r\n" + "<head>\r\n" + "    <title>Something</title>\r\n"
                + "</head>\r\n" + "<body>\r\n" + "    <div>\r\n" + "        <h1>First div title</h1>\r\n"
                + "        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua</p>\r\n"
                + "    </div>\r\n" + "\r\n" + "    <div>\r\n" + "        <h1>Second div title</h1>\r\n"
                + "        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua</p>\r\n"
                + "    </div>\r\n" + "</body>\r\n" + "</html>";

    html = html.replace("Something", title);
    System.out.println(html);
}
````

## G2 Obvious Behavior is Unimplemented
Always implement the obvious expected behavior, otherwise developers will lose confidence in your code.

Suggestion: Implement the obvious behavior, or if not possible you should explain in the documentation why not.

:-1:
````java
public void read(MyObject myObject) {
    write(myObject);
}
````

## G3 Incorrect Behavior at the Boundaries
It's common to find bugs in the boundaries of the system. 

Suggestion: Ensure boundaries are being tested.

:-1:
````java
public void doSomething(String word) {
        switch (word.toUpperCase()){
        case "WORD1":
            System.out.println("do1 and exit");  // <-- didn't test this case statement and forgot break statement. Bug
        case "WORD2":
            System.out.println("do2 and exit");
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("exit");
        }
    }
````

## G4 Overridden Safeties 
Test and compiler checks are usefull to warn you something might be wrong. Disabling it will only bring you troubles.

Suggestion: fix the test, in case of compiler warning, refactor or only disable it if you are certain the error won't happen and add a comment explaing why.

:-1:
````java
@Ignore
@Test
public void testSomething() {
    //
}

@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public <E> E[] doSomething(E... vararg) {
    return vararg;
}

````

## G5 Duplication 
Whenver you find duplicate code, it means you lost a chance for abstraction. Duplicated identical code, repetition of `switch/case` and `if/else` in several methods, same implementation of an algorithm but written differently.

Suggestion: Simplify by adding a layer of abstraction.

:-1:
````java
public String getStringWithBiggerLength(List<String> words) {
    String wordWithBiggerLength = words.get(0);

    for (int i = 1; i < words.size(); i++) {
        if (wordWithBiggerLength.length() < words.get(i).length()) {
            wordWithBiggerLength = words.get(i);
        }
    }
    return wordWithBiggerLength;
}

public boolean isBiggerThanWordWithBiggerLenght(List<String> words, String word) {
    String wordWithBiggerLength = words.get(0);

    for (int i = 1; i < words.size(); i++) {
        if (wordWithBiggerLength.length() < words.get(i).length()) {
            wordWithBiggerLength = words.get(i);
        }
    }
    return wordWithBiggerLength.length() < word.length();
}
````

## G6 Code at Wrong Level of Abstraction 
Keep consistent the level of abstraction you are using in your code, component, module, system ...

Suggestion: Refactor to achieve the same abstraction level of the rest of your code...

:-1:
````java
public Document persist(Document document) {
    validate(document);

    if (alreadyExists(document)) {
        return document;
     }

    Connection conn = null;
    Properties connectionProps = new Properties();
    connectionProps.put("user", this.userName);
    connectionProps.put("password", this.password);

    conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/", connectionProps);
        
    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
        
    stmt.executeUpdate("insert into ...");
}
````

## G7 Base Classes Depending on Their Derivatives 
Breaking the logic of a base class in deratives, means you are adding an abstraction level in your code. Therefore, if the base class is dependant of the derivative class' internal behaviors, there might be a problem.

Suggestion: Refactor the base class to not depend on the derivative internal behavior.

:-1:
````java
class ControllerClazz{
    
    public void doSomething(){
        ServiceClazz serviceClazz = new ServiceClazz();
        List<String> namesSorted = serviceClazz.getNamesSorted();
        
        for(String name: namesSorted) {
            //
        }
            
        new ServiceClazz2().doSomething();
    }
    
}

class ServiceClazz{
    public void doSomething() {
        getNamesSorted();
        //
    }
    
    public List<String> getNamesSorted(){
        //
    }
}

class ServiceClazz2{
    public void doSomething() {
        
    }
}
````

## G8 Too Much Information 
A well defined API has just enought information to do a lot with litle information. The less information you expose the less coupling with client classes.

Suggestion: Reduce the information you are exposing.

:-1:
````java
public class Something {
    public String somethingInternal;
    public static final String INTERNAL_ERROR = "INTERNAL ERROR";
    
    public void doSomething() {
        //
    }
    
    public void doLessThanSomething() {
        //
    }
    
    public void doLessThanLessSomething() {
        //
    }
    
    public String getSomethingInternal() {
        return somethingInternal;
    }
}
````


## G9 Dead Code
Any code that is unreacheable. Either because it got old, or because it's a conditional that not happen.

Suggestion: Remove it.

:-1:
````java
public void doSomething() throws IllegalArgumentException {
    // never throws IllegalArgumentException
}

public void doSomething(String name) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(name);

    if (name == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Null pointer");
    }

    System.out.println(name);
}
````

## G10 Vertical Separation 
When a variable or function is declared far away from its usage.

Suggestion: Declare variables before its use, declare functions below its invocation.

:-1:
````java
public void doSomething() {
    String name;
    int age;
    String city;
        
    doAnotherthing();
    processWhatever();
    //...
        
    System.out.println(name);
    System.out.println(age);
    System.out.println(city);
}
````

## G11 Inconsistency 
When decided over a convetion, apply it consistently in other similar situation to avoid surprises and improve readbility.

Suggestion: Refactor the code to achieve the convention.

:-1:
````java
public void doSomething(HttpServletRequest request) {
//
}
    
public void doAnotherThing(HttpServletRequest servlet) {
//
}
    
public void doAThirdThing(HttpServletRequest request) {
//        
}
````

## G12 Clutter
Methods, attributes and variables that are not used, comments that don't add anything.

Suggestion: Remove the clutter from your code.

:-1:
````java
public class Class {
    private void dontDoSomething() {
        // unreacheable by client code and never used locally.
    }
}
````

## G13 Artificial Coupling 
A generic variable, constant, function or enum is placed within a specific class.

Suggestion: Decouple the generic component from the specific component.

:-1:
````java
public class Clazz {
    public static enum Country {
        BR, AR, US, GE;
    }
}

public class ClientCode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Clazz.Country.AR);
    }
}
````

## G14 Feature Envy
When a method uses getters and setters from other classes to manipulate this object, the method is envying the feature of the object.

Suggestion: Move the the method that is envying the feature to the object.

:-1:
````java
public class HourlyPayCalculator {
    public Money calculateWeeklyPay(HourlyEmployee e) {
        int tenthRate = e.getTenthRate().getPennies();
        int tenthsWorked = e.getTenthWorded();
        int straightTime = Math.min(400, tenthsWorked);
        int overTime = Math.max(0, tenthsWorked - straightTime);
        int straightPay = straightTime * tenthRate;
        int overtimePay = (int) Math.round(overTime * tenthRate * 1.5);
        return new Money(straightPay + overTime);
    }
}
````
